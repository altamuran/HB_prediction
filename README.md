# HB_prediction
 this project aims to estimate a hemoglobin level through an index (Erythema Index) recovered by video analysis. 
 is the product of the study of the correlation between hemoglobin and this index. 
 The project will also show and use an estimate of red in the same way we use Erythema index
The evolution of a case is of study, through appropriate calculations on frames extracted from the elaboration of a small video film, and the hemoglobin level of subjects subjected to tests.
The erythema index is an empirical index that combines some monochromatic images at various lengths.
Hemoglobin is a pigment of red blood cells, which is the transport of oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. The minimum values of a healthy person are 12.0 g / dL for women and 13.0 g / dL for men. Since the fingertip is a particularly vascularized tissue, it is interesting to note that the amount of color is a video recorded in direct contact with the fabric.
